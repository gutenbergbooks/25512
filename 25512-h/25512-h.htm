that will only display in UTF-8 (Unicode) file encoding, including a few
words of accented Greek:</p>

<p>If any of these characters do not display properly, or if the
apostrophes and quotation marks in this paragraph appear as garbage, you
may have an incompatible browser or unavailable fonts. First, make sure
that the browser’s “character set” or “file encoding” is set to Unicode

<p>The text is taken from an omnibus volume that also contained Riley’s
translation of the six surviving plays of Terence. The full title page
has been retained for completeness, but the sections of the Preface and
Contents that apply only to Terence have been omitted.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been renumbered within each Book. Footnote tags that
were missing in the original are <a class = "tag missing">underlined</a>
without further annotation. The name is spelled “Æsop” in Riley, “Esop”
in Smart and in the Contents. Inconsistencies in fable numbering are
described at the beginning of the <a href = "#contents">Table of
Contents</a>.</p>

<p>A few typographical errors have been corrected. They are
marked in the text with <ins class = "correction" title =
"like this">mouse-hover popups</ins>.</p>

PREFACE.</a></h3>

<hr class = "micro">

<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> the Translation of Phædrus, the
Critical Edition by Orellius, 1831, has been used, and in the Æsopian
Fables, the text of the Parisian Edition of Gail, 1826. The Notes will,
it is believed, be found to embody the little that is known of the
contemporary history of the Author.</p>

<p class = "right">
H. T. R.</p>

<div class = "mynote">

<p>The <a name = "contents" id = "contents">Table of Contents</a> refers
primarily to the Riley text. Fables
<span class = "smallcaps">I.xxix</span>, <span class =
"smallcaps">III.iii</span>, and several Fables in Book IV are missing in
Smart; Riley’s Fable <span class = "smallcaps">IV.i</span>, “The Ass and
the Priests of Cybele”, is Smart’s <span class =
"smallcaps">III.xix</span>. Where Smart’s numbers are different, they
are shown with <ins class = "renumber" title = "like this">popups</ins>.</p>

<p>In the text, Book III, Fable <span class = "smallcaps">xi</span> is
“The Eunuch to the Abusive Man”; all following fables in Riley are
numbered one higher than in the Table of Contents. This fable is missing
from Smart but the number X is skipped, as was number <span class =
"smallcaps">I.xviii</span>.</p>

The advantages of <i>this</i> little work are twofold&mdash;that it

THE WOLF AND THE LAMB.</h4>

<p>Driven by thirst, a Wolf and a Lamb had come to the same stream; the
Wolf stood above, and the Lamb at a distance below. Then, the spoiler,
prompted by a ravenous maw, alleged a pretext for a quarrel. “Why,” said
he, “have you made the water muddy for me <i>while I am</i> drinking?”
The Fleece-bearer, trembling, <i>answered</i>: “Prithee, Wolf, how can I
do what you complain of? The water is flowing downwards from you to
where I am drinking.” The other, disconcerted by the force of truth,
<i>exclaimed</i>: “Six months ago, you slandered me.” “Indeed<ins class

<span class = "pagenum">366</span>
the Lamb, “I&nbsp;was not born <i>then</i>.” “By Hercules,” said <i>the
Wolf</i>, “<i>then ’twas</i> your father slandered me;” and so,
snatching him up, he tore him to pieces, killing him unjustly.</p>

<p>This Fable is applicable to those men who, under false pretences,
oppress the innocent.</p>

THE FROGS ASKING FOR A KING.</h4>

<p>When Athens<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_1" id = "tagI_1" href =
"#noteI_1">I.1</a> was flourishing under just laws, liberty grown wanton
embroiled the city, and license relaxed the reins of ancient discipline.
Upon this, the partisans of factions conspiring, Pisistratus the
Tyrant<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_2" id = "tagI_2" href =
"#noteI_2">I.2</a> seized the citadel. When the Athenians were lamenting
their sad servitude (not that he was cruel, but because every burden is
grievous to those who are unused to it), and began to complain, Æsop
related a Fable to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Frogs, roaming at large in their marshy fens, with loud clamour
demanded of Jupiter a king, who, by <i>his</i> authority, might check
their dissolute manners. The Father of the Gods smiled, and gave them a
little Log, which, on being thrown <i>among them</i> startled the
timorous race by the noise and sudden commotion in the bog. When it had
lain for some time immersed in the mud, one <i>of them</i> by chance
silently lifted his head above the water, and having taken a peep at the
king, called up all the rest. Having got the better of their fears,
vying with each other, they swim towards him, and the insolent mob leap
upon the Log. After defiling it with every kind of insult, they sent to
Jupiter, requesting another king, because the one that had been given
them was useless. Upon this, he sent them a Water Snake,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagI_3" id = "tagI_3" href = "#noteI_3">I.3</a> who with
<span class = "pagenum">367</span>
his sharp teeth began to gobble them up one after another. Helpless they
strive in vain to escape death; terror deprives them of voice. By
stealth, therefore, they send through Mercury a request to Jupiter, to
succour them in their distress. Then said the God in reply: ‘Since you
would not be content with your good fortune, continue to endure your bad

THE VAIN JACKDAW AND THE PEACOCK.</h4>

<p>That one ought not to plume oneself on the merits which belong to

<p>A Jackdaw, swelling<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_4" id = "tagI_4"

which had fallen from a Peacock, and decked himself out
<i>therewith</i>; upon which, despising his own <i>kind</i>, he mingled
with a beauteous flock of Peacocks. They tore his feathers from off the
impudent bird, and put him to flight with their beaks. The Jackdaw,
<i>thus</i> roughly handled, in grief hastened to return to his own
kind; repulsed by whom, he had to submit to sad disgrace. Then said one
of those whom he had formerly despised: “If you had been content with
our station, and had been ready to put up with what nature had given,
you would neither have experienced the former affront, nor would your

<p>A bone that he had swallowed stuck in the jaws of a Wolf. Thereupon,

<p>This story shows that what you contemn is often found of more utility
than what you load with praises.</p>

<p>A Stag, when he had drunk at a stream, stood still, and gazed upon
his likeness in the water. While there, in admiration, he was praising
his branching horns, and finding fault with the extreme thinness of his
legs, suddenly roused by the cries of the huntsmen, he took to flight
over the plain, and with nimble course escaped the dogs. Then a wood
received the beast; in which, being entangled and caught by his horns,
the dogs began to tear him to pieces with savage bites. While dying, he
is said to have uttered these words: “Oh, how unhappy am I, who now too
late find out how useful to me were the things that I despised; and what
sorrow the things I used to praise, have caused me.”</p>

this, the other, while, in his folly, attempting to show off his voice,
let fall the cheese from his mouth, which the crafty Fox with greedy

THE KITE AND THE PIGEONS.</h4>

<p>He who entrusts himself to the protection of a wicked man, while he
seeks assistance, meets with destruction.</p>

<p>Some Pigeons, having often escaped from a Kite, and by their
swiftness of wing avoided death, the spoiler had recourse to stratagem,
and by a crafty device of this nature, deceived the harmless race. “Why
do you prefer to live a life of anxiety, rather than conclude a treaty,
and make me <i>your</i> king, who can ensure your safety from every
injury?” They, putting confidence in him, entrusted themselves to the
Kite, who, on obtaining the sovereignty, began to devour them one by
one, and to exercise authority with his cruel talons. Then said one of
those that were left: “Deservedly are we smitten.”</p>

government of Solon, when Archon of Athens.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_2" id = "noteI_2" href = "#tagI_2">2.</a>
<i>Pisistratus the Tyrant</i>)&mdash;Ver. 5. From Suidas and Eusebius we
learn that Æsop died in the fifty-fourth Olympiad, while Pisistratus did
not seize the supreme power at Athens till the first year of the
fifty-fifth. These dates, however, have been disputed by many, and
partly on the strength of the present passage.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_3" id = "noteI_3" href = "#tagI_3">3.</a>
<i>A Water-Snake</i>)&mdash;Ver. 24. Pliny tells us that the “hydrus”
lives in the water, and is exceedingly venomous. Some Commentators think
that Phædrus, like Æsop, intends to conceal a political meaning under
this Fable, and that by the Water-Snake he means Caligula, and by the
Log, Tiberius. Others, perhaps with more probability, think that the
cruelty of Tiberius alone is alluded to in the mention of the snake.
Indeed, it is doubtful whether Phædrus survived to the time of Caligula:
and it is more generally believed that the First and Second Books were
written in the time of Augustus and Tiberius.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_4" id = "noteI_4" href = "#tagI_4">4.</a>
<i>A Jackdaw, swelling</i>)&mdash;Ver. 4. Scheffer thinks that Sejanus
is alluded to under this image.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_5" id = "noteI_5" href = "#tagI_5">5.</a>
<i>As a Dog swimming</i>)&mdash;Ver. 9. Lessing finds some fault with
the way in which this Fable is related, and with fair reason. The Dog
swimming would be likely to disturb the water to such a degree, that it
would be impossible for him to see with any distinctness the reflection
of the meat. The version which represents him as crossing a bridge is
certainly more consistent with nature.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_6" id = "noteI_6" href = "#tagI_6">6.</a>
<i>And a Sheep</i>)&mdash;Ver. 3. Lessing also censures this Fable on
the ground of the partnership being contrary to nature; neither the cow,
the goat, nor the sheep feed on flesh.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_7" id = "noteI_7" href = "#tagI_7">7.</a>
<i>I am the strongest</i>)&mdash;Ver. 9. Some critics profess to see no
difference between “sum fortis” in the eighth line, and “plus valeo”
here; but the former expression appears to refer to his courage, and the
latter to his strength. However, the second and third reasons are
nothing but reiterations of the first one, under another form. Davidson
remarks on this passage: “I&nbsp;am not certain that the Poet meant any
distinction; nay, there is, perhaps, a&nbsp;propriety in supposing that
he industriously makes the Lion plead twice upon the same title, to
represent more strongly by what unjust claims men in power often invade
the property of another.”</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_8" id = "noteI_8" href = "#tagI_8">8.</a>
<i>Taking a wife</i>)&mdash;Ver. 3. It has been suggested by Brotier and
Desbillons, that in this Fable Phædrus covertly alludes to the marriage
which was contemplated by Livia, or Livilla, the daughter of the elder
Drusus and Antonia, and the wife of her first-cousin, the younger
Drusus, with the infamous Sejanus, the minister and favourite of
Tiberius, after having, with his assistance, removed her husband by
poison. In such case, the Frogs will represent the Roman people, the Sun
Sejanus, who had greatly oppressed them, and by Jupiter, Tiberius will
be meant.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_9" id = "noteI_9" href = "#tagI_9">9.</a>
<i>Has no brains</i>)&mdash;Ver. 2. To make the sense of this remark of
the Fox the more intelligible, we must bear in mind that the ancient
masks covered the whole head, and sometimes extended down to the
shoulders; consequently, their resemblance to the human head was much
more striking than in the masks of the present day.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_10" id = "noteI_10" href = "#tagI_10">10.</a>
<i>To be heedless</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1. “Cavere” is a word of legal

<p><a name = "noteI_11" id = "noteI_11" href = "#tagI_11">11.</a>
<i>Devoid of courage</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1. Burmann suggests, with great
probability, that Phædrus had here in mind those braggart warriors, who
have been so well described by Plautus and Terence, under the characters
of Pyrgopolynices and Thraso.</p>

a house in which articles of food were exposed for sale, is probably
meant.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_14" id = "noteI_14" href = "#tagI_14">14.</a>
<i>By this story</i>)&mdash;Ver. 13. Heinsius thinks this line and the
next to be spurious; because, though Phædrus sometimes at the beginning
mentions the design of his Fable, he seldom does so at the end. In this
conjecture he is followed by Bentley, Sanadon, and many others of the
learned.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_15" id = "noteI_15" href = "#tagI_15">15.</a>
<i>Selling his antidote</i>)&mdash;Ver. 3. “Antidotum” probably means a
universal remedy, capable of curing all natural diseases, as well as
neutralizing the effects of poison.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_16" id = "noteI_16" href = "#tagI_16">16.</a>
<i>Trust your lives</i>)&mdash;Ver. 15. He seems to pun upon the word
“capita,” as meaning not only “the life,” but “the head,” in
contradistinction to “the feet,” mentioned in the next line. As in
l.&nbsp;2 we find that he came to a place where he was not known, we
must suppose that the Cobbler confessed to the King his former
calling.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_17" id = "noteI_17" href = "#tagI_17">17.</a>
<i>For a measure</i>)&mdash;Ver. 3. Properly “modius;” the principal dry
measure of the Romans. It was equal to one-third of the amphora, and
therefore to nearly two gallons English.</p>

Tiberius.</p>

a Fable, but as a true narrative.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_21" id = "noteI_21" href = "#tagI_21">21.</a>
<i>Ready to whelp</i>)&mdash;Ver. 3. Justin, B.&nbsp;I., c.&nbsp;3,
mentions this Fable with some little variation, as being related by a
Ligurian to Comanus, the son of King Nannus, who had granted (about B.C.
540) some land to the Phocæans for the foundation of the city of
Massilia; signifying thereby that the natives would be quickly
dispossessed by the newcomers.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_22" id = "noteI_22" href = "#tagI_22">22.</a>
<i>With flashing tusks</i>)&mdash;Ver. 5. “Fulmineus,” “lightning-like,”
is an epithet given by Ovid and Statius also, to the tusks of the wild
boar; probably by reason of their sharpness and the impetuosity of the
blow inflicted thereby. Scheffer suggests that they were so called from
their white appearance among the black hair of the boar’s head.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_23" id = "noteI_23" href = "#tagI_23">23.</a>
<i>Which was the bigger</i>)&mdash;Ver. 8. “Quis major esset. Illi
dixerunt Bovem.” Bentley censures this line, and thinks it spurious. In
good Latin, he says “uter” would occupy the place of “quis,” and “bovem”
would be replaced by “bos.”</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_24" id = "noteI_24" href = "#tagI_24">24.</a>
<i>It has been related</i>)&mdash;Ver. 3. Pliny, in his Natural History,
B.&nbsp;viii. c.&nbsp;40, and Ælian, in his Various and Natural
Histories, relate the same fact as to the dogs drinking of the Nile. “To
treat a thing, as the dogs do the Nile,” was a common proverb with the
ancients, signifying to do it superficially; corresponding with our
homely saying, “To give it a lick and a promise.” Macrobius, in the
Saturnalia, B.&nbsp;i. c.&nbsp;2, mentions a story, that after the
defeat at Mutina, when enquiry was made as to what had become of Antony,
one of his servants made answer: “He has done what the dogs do in Egypt,
he drank and ran away<ins class = "correction" title = "text has , for .">.” &nbsp;</ins></p>

<p><a name = "noteI_25" id = "noteI_25" href = "#tagI_25">25.</a>
<i>Of minced meat</i>)&mdash;Ver. 7. “Intritus cibus,” is thought here
to signify a peculiar dish, consisting of bread soaked in milk, cheese,
garlic, and other herbs.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_26" id = "noteI_26" href = "#tagI_26">26.</a>
<i>Narrow-mouthed jar</i>)&mdash;Ver. 8. The <ins class = "correction"
title = "standard form is ‘lagoena’">“lagena,” or “lagona,”</ins> was a
long-necked bottle or flagon, made of earth, and much used for keeping
wine or fruit.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_27" id = "noteI_27" href = "#tagI_27">27.</a>
<i>The foreign bird</i>)&mdash;Ver. 11. Alluding probably to the
migratory habits of the stork, or the fact of her being especially a
native of Egypt.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_28" id = "noteI_28" href = "#tagI_28">28.</a>
<i>Human bones</i>)&mdash;Ver. 3. This plainly refers to the custom
which prevailed among the ancients, of burying golden ornaments, and
even money, with the dead; which at length was practised to such an
excess, that at Rome the custom was forbidden by law. It was probably
practised to a great extent by the people of Etruria; if we may judge
from the discoveries of golden ornaments frequently made in their
tombs.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_29" id = "noteI_29" href = "#tagI_29">29.</a>
<i>Gods the Manes</i>)&mdash;Ver. 4. Perhaps by “Deos Manes” are meant
the good and bad Genii of the deceased.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_30" id = "noteI_30" href = "#tagI_30">30.</a>
<i>The ass, with legs</i>)&mdash;Ver. 7. This line is somewhat modified
in the translation.</p>

<p><a name = "noteI_31" id = "noteI_31" href = "#tagI_31">31.</a>

Horace, “Quicquid delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi.”</p>

<p>While a Lion was standing over a Bullock, which he had brought to the

THE EAGLE, THE CAT, AND THE WILD SOW.</h4>

<p>An Eagle had made her nest at the top of an oak; a&nbsp;Cat who had
found a hole in the middle, had kittened <i>there</i>; a&nbsp;Sow,
a&nbsp;dweller in the woods, had laid her offspring at the bottom. Then
thus does the Cat with deceit and wicked malice, destroy the community
so formed by accident. She mounts up to the nest of the Bird:
“Destruction,” says she, “is preparing for you, perhaps, too, for
wretched me; for as you see, the Sow, digging up the earth every day, is
insidiously trying to overthrow the oak, that she may easily seize our
progeny on the ground.” Having <i>thus</i> spread terror, and bewildered
<i>the Eagle’s</i> senses, the Cat creeps down to the lair of the
bristly Sow: “In great danger,” says she, “are your offspring; for as
soon as you go out to forage with your young litter, the Eagle is ready
to snatch away from you your little pigs.” Having filled this place
likewise with alarm, she cunningly hides herself in her safe hole.
Thence she wanders forth on tiptoe by night, and having filled herself
and her offspring with food, she looks out all day long, pretending
alarm. Fearing the downfall, the Eagle sits still in the branches; to
avoid the attack of the spoiler, the Sow stirs not abroad. Why make a
long story?

CÆSAR TO THE CHAMBERLAIN.</h4>

<p>There is a certain set of busybodies at Rome, hurriedly running to

quickened by the joyous hope of a sure reward. Then, in a jesting tone,

<p>An Eagle carried a Tortoise aloft, who had hidden her body in her

injured in any way. A&nbsp;Crow came through the air, and flying near,
exclaimed: “You really have carried off a rich prize in your talons; but
if I don’t instruct you what you must do, in vain will you tire yourself
with the heavy weight.” A&nbsp;share being promised her, she persuades
the Eagle to dash the hard shell from the lofty stars upon a rock, that,
it being broken to pieces, she may easily feed upon the meat. Induced by
her words, the Eagle attends to her suggestion, and at the same time
gives a large share of the banquet to her instructress.</p>

THE STAG AND THE OXEN.</h4>

<p>A Stag, aroused from his woodland lair, to avoid impending death
threatened by huntsmen, repaired with blind fear to the nearest
farm-house, and hid himself in an ox-stall close at hand. Upon this, an
Ox said to him, as he concealed himself: “Why, what do you mean, unhappy
one, in thus rushing of your own accord upon
<span class = "pagenum">388</span>
destruction, and trusting your life to the abode of man?” To this he
suppliantly replied: “Do you only spare me; the moment an opportunity is
given I will again rush forth.” Night in her turn takes the place of
day; the Neat-herd brings fodder, but yet sees him not. All the farm
servants pass and repass every now and then; no one perceives him; even
the Steward passes by, nor does he observe anything. Upon this, the
stag, in his joy, began to return thanks to the Oxen who had kept so
still, because they had afforded him hospitality in the hour of
adversity. One of them made answer: “We really do wish you well; but if

dinner; and having lately seen the Oxen in bad condition, comes up to
the rack: “Why,” says he, “is there so little fodder? Is litter scarce?

<p>The Athenians erected a statue to the genius of Æsop, and placed him,
though a slave, upon an everlasting pedestal, that all might know that
the way to fame is open to all, and that glory is not awarded to birth
but to merit. Since another<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_17" id =

made it my object, a&nbsp;thing which still lay in my power, that he
should not be the only one. Nor is this envy, but emulation; and if
Latium shall favour my efforts, she will have still more <i>authors</i>
whom she may match with Greece. <i>But</i> if jealousy shall attempt to
detract from my labours, still it shall not deprive me of the
consciousness of deserving praise. If my attempts reach your ears, and
<i>your</i> taste relishes <i>these</i> Fables, as being composed with
skill, <i>my</i> success <i>then</i> banishes every complaint. But if,
on the contrary, my learned labours fall into the hands of those whom a
perverse nature has brought to the light of day, and <i>who</i> are
unable to do anything except carp at their betters, I&nbsp;shall endure
my unhappy destiny<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_18" id = "tagII_18"

<i>Is anything else</i>)&mdash;Ver. 2. Burmann thinks that the object of
the Author in this Prologue is to defend himself against the censures of
those who might blame him for not keeping to his purpose, mentioned in
the Prologue of the First Book, of adhering to the fabulous matter used
by Æsop, but mixing up with such stories narratives of events that had
happened in his own time.</p>

contemporary narratives as are found in Fable v. of the present Book; in
Fable x. of the Third; in B.&nbsp;IV., Fables v., xxi., xxiv.; and

<i>Of middle age</i>)&mdash;Ver 8. It has been a matter of doubt among
Commentators to which “ætatis mediæ” applies&mdash;the man or the woman.
But as she is called “anus,” <!-- **P3 inhales her coffee --> “an Old
Woman,” in the last line, it is most probable that the man is meant.</p>

<p class = "mynote">
The Latin language had two unrelated words spelled “anus”. The one
referenced here is “anūs” with long final <b>u</b>.</p>

<i>Country-seat at Misenum</i>)&mdash;Ver. 8. This villa was situate on
Cape Misenum, a&nbsp;promontory of Campania, near Baiæ and Cumæ, so
called from Misenus, the trumpeter of Æneas, who was said to have been
buried there. The villa was originally built by C. Marius, and was
bought by Cornelia, and then by Lucullus, who either rebuilt it or added
extensively to it.</p>

<i>Of the chamberlains</i>)&mdash;Ver. 11. The “atrienses” were a
superior class of the domestic slaves. It was their duty to take charge
of the “atrium,” or hall; to escort visitors or clients, and to explain
to strangers all matters connected with the pictures, statues, and other
decorations of the house.</p>

<p><a name = "noteII_9" id = "noteII_9" href = "#tagII_9">9.</a>
<i>To sprinkle</i>)&mdash;Ver. 16. Burmann suggests that this duty did
not belong to the “atriensis,” who would consequently think that his
courteous politeness would on that account be still more pleasing to the
Emperor.</p>

<i>Much higher price</i>)&mdash;Ver. 25. He alludes to the Roman mode of
manumission, or setting the slaves at liberty. Before the master
presented the slave to the Quæstor, to have the “vindicta,” or lictor’s
rod, laid on him, he turned him round and gave him a blow on the face.
In the word “veneunt,” “sell,” there is a reference to the purchase of
their liberty by the slaves, which was often effected by means of their
“peculium,” or savings.</p>

<i>Carrying baskets</i>)&mdash;Ver. 2. “Fisci” were baskets made of
twigs, or panniers, in which the Romans kept and carried about sums of
money. Being used especially in the Roman treasury, the word in time
came to signify the money itself. Hence our word “fiscal.”</p>

Heinsius thinks that he refers to C. Mecænas Melissus, mentioned by
Ovid, in his Pontic Epistles, B.&nbsp;iv., El. xvi., l.&nbsp;30,
a&nbsp;freedman of Mecænas, who compiled a book of jests partly from the
works <ins class = "correction" title = "f invisible">of</ins> Æsop.

<p>If you have a desire, Eutychus, to read the little books of Phædrus,
you must keep yourself disengaged from business, that your mind, at
liberty, may relish the meaning of the lines. “But,” you say, “my genius
is not of such great value, that a moment of time should be lost <i>for
it</i> to my own pursuits.” There is no reason then why that should be
touched by your hands which is not suited for ears so engaged. Perhaps
you will say, “some holidays will come,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIII_2" id = "tagIII_2" href = "#noteIII_2">III.2</a> which
<span class = "pagenum">391</span>
will invite me to study with mind unbent.” Will you <i>rather</i>,
I&nbsp;ask you, read worthless ditties,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIII_3" id = "tagIII_3" href = "#noteIII_3">III.3</a> than bestow
attention upon your domestic concerns, give moments to your friends,
your leisure to your wife, relax your mind, and refresh your body, in
order that you may return more efficiently to your wonted duties? You
must change your purpose and your mode of life, if you have thoughts of
crossing the threshold of the Muses. I, whom my mother brought forth on
the Pierian hill,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_4" id = "tagIII_4" href
= "#noteIII_4">III.4</a> upon which hallowed Mnemosyne, nine times
fruitful, bore the choir of Muses to thundering Jove: although I was
born almost in the very school itself, and have entirely erased
<i>all</i> care for acquiring wealth from my breast, and with the
approval of many have applied myself to these pursuits, am still with
difficulty received into the choir <i>of the Poets</i>. What do you
imagine must be the lot of him who seeks, with ceaseless vigilance, to
amass great wealth, preferring the sweets of gain to the labours of
learning?</p>

<p>But now, come of it what may (as Sinon said<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIII_5" id = "tagIII_5" href = "#noteIII_5">III.5</a> when he
<span class = "pagenum">392</span>

<p>Now will I explain in a few words why Fabulous narrative was
invented. Slavery,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_7" id = "tagIII_7"
href = "#noteIII_7">III.7</a> subject to the will of another, because it
did not dare to say what it wished, couched its sentiments in Fables,
and by pleasing fictions eluded censure. In place of its foot-path I
have made a road, and have invented more than it left, selecting some
points to my own misfortune.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_8" id =

"#noteIII_9">III.9</a> had been the informer, if any other the witness,
if any other the judge, in fine, I&nbsp;should confess myself deserving
of such severe woes; nor should I soothe my sorrow with these
expedients. If any one shall make erroneous surmises, and apply to
himself what is applicable to all in common, he will absurdly expose the
secret convictions of his mind. And still, to him I would hold myself
excused; for it is no intention of mine to point at individuals, but to
describe life itself and the manners of mankind. Perhaps some one will
say, that I undertake a
<span class = "pagenum">393</span>
weighty task. If Æsop of Phrygia, if Anacharsis of Scythia<a class =
"tag missing" name = "tagIII_10" id = "tagIII_10" href =
"#noteIII_10">III.10</a> could, by their genius, found a lasting fame,
why should I who am more nearly related to learned Greece, forsake in
sluggish indolence the glories of my country? especially as the Thracian
race numbers its own authors, and Apollo was the parent of Linus,
a&nbsp;Muse of Orpheus, who with his song moved rocks and tamed wild
beasts, and held the current of Hebrus in sweet suspense. Away then,
envy! nor lament in vain, because to me the customary fame is due.</p>

stones; while some, on the other hand, moved with compassion, seeing
that she must die even though no one should hurt her, threw her some
bread to sustain existence. Night comes on apace; homeward they go
without concern, making sure of finding her dead on the following day.
She, however, after having recruited her failing strength, with a swift
bound effected her escape from the pit, and with hurried pace hastened
to her den. A&nbsp;few days intervening, she sallies forth, slaughters
the flocks, kills the shepherds themselves, and laying waste every side,
rages with unbridled fury. Upon this those who had shown mercy to the
beast,
<span class = "pagenum">395</span>
alarmed for their safety, made no demur to the loss <i>of their flocks,
and</i> begged only for their lives. But she <i>thus answered them</i>:
“I&nbsp;remember him who attacked me with stones, <i>and</i> him who
gave me bread; lay aside your fears; I&nbsp;return as an enemy to those

<p>One taught by experience is proverbially said to be more

now for the first time, shall be made known by my Fable.</p>

<p>The ewes of a certain Man who reared flocks, brought forth lambs with
human heads. Dreadfully alarmed at the prodigy, he runs full of concern
to the soothsayers. One answers that it bears reference to the life of
the owner, and that the danger must be averted with a victim. Another,
no wiser, affirms that it is meant that his wife is an adultress, and
his children are spurious; but that it can be atoned for by a victim of
greater age.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_17" id = "tagIII_17" href =

greatly aggravate the anxiety of the Man. Æsop being at hand,

precautions against <i>this</i> portent, find wives for your

<p>A Wolf, quite starved with hunger, chanced to meet a well-fed Dog,
and as they stopped to salute each other, “Pray,” <i>said the
Wolf</i>,<ins class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">
“</ins>how is it that you are so sleek? or on what food have you made so
much flesh? I, who am far stronger, am perishing with hunger.” The Dog
frankly <i>replied</i>: “You may enjoy the same condition, if you can
render the like service to your master.” “What <i>is it?</i>” said the
other. “To be the guardian of his threshold, <i>and</i> to protect the
house from thieves at night.” “I&nbsp;am quite ready for that,” <i>said
the Wolf</i>; “at present I have to endure snow and showers, dragging on
a wretched existence in the woods. How much more pleasant for me to be
living under a roof, and, at my ease, to be stuffed with plenty of
victuals.” “Come along, then, with me,” <i>said the Dog</i>. As they
were going along, the Wolf observed the neck of the Dog, where it was
worn with the chain. “Whence comes this, my friend?” “Oh, it is
nothing.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_22" id = "tagIII_22" href =

fierce, they fasten me up in the day-time, that I may be quiet when it
is light, and watch when night comes; unchained at midnight,
I&nbsp;wander wherever I please. Bread is brought me without my asking;
from his own table my master gives me bones; the servants throw me bits,
and whatever dainties each person leaves; thus, without trouble <i>on my
part</i>, is my belly filled.” “Well, if you have a mind to go anywhere,
are you at liberty?” “Certainly not,” replied <i>the Dog</i>.
“<i>Then</i>, Dog, enjoy what you boast of; I&nbsp;would not be a king,
to lose my liberty.”</p>

against the Son, how that he, though a male, has been meddling with a
thing that belongs to the women. Embracing them both, kissing them, and
dividing his tender affection between the two, he said: “I&nbsp;wish you
both to use the mirror every day: you, that you may not spoil your

THE POET, ON BELIEVING, AND NOT BELIEVING.</h4>

<p>It is dangerous alike to believe or to disbelieve. Of either fact,

<p>Hippolytus met his death,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_25" id =

believed: because Cassandra was not believed, Troy fell. Therefore, we
ought to examine strictly into the truth of a matter, rather than
<i>suffer</i> an erroneous impression to pervert our judgment. But, that
I may not weaken <i>this truth</i> by referring to fabulous antiquity,
I&nbsp;will relate to you a thing that happened within my own
memory.</p>

<p>A certain married Man, who was very fond of his Wife, having now
provided the white toga<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_26" id =
"tagIII_26" href = "#noteIII_26">III.26</a> for his Son, was privately
taken aside by his Freedman, who hoped that he should be substituted as
his next heir, <i>and</i> who, after telling many lies about the youth,
and still more about the misconduct of the chaste Wife, added, what he
knew would especially grieve one so fond, that a gallant was in the
habit of paying her visits, and that the honor of his house was stained
with base adultery. Enraged at the supposed guilt of his Wife, the
husband pretended a journey to his country-house, and privately stayed
behind in town; then at night he suddenly entered at the door, making
straight to his Wife’s apartment,
<span class = "pagenum">400</span>
in which the mother had ordered her son to sleep, keeping a strict eye
over his ripening years. While they are seeking for a light, while the

on himself for his guilt, and fell upon the sword which a too easy

THE BEES AND THE DRONES, THE WASP SITTING AS&nbsp;JUDGE.</h4>

<p>Some Bees had made their combs in a lofty oak. Some lazy Drones
asserted that these belonged to them. The cause was brought into court,
the Wasp <i>sitting as</i> judge; who, being perfectly acquainted with
either race, proposed to the two parties these terms: “Your shape is not
unlike, and your colour is similar; so that the affair clearly and
fairly becomes a matter of doubt. But that my sacred duty may not be at
fault through insufficiency of knowledge, <i>each of you</i> take hives,
and pour your productions into the waxen cells; that from the flavour of
the honey and the shape of the comb, the maker of them, about which the
present dispute exists, may be evident.” The Drones decline; the
proposal pleases the Bees. Upon this, the Wasp pronounces sentence to
the following effect: “It is evident who cannot, and who did, make
<i>them</i>; wherefore, to the Bees I restore the fruits of their
labours.”</p>

done.” The people gather round. The man torments his invention a long
time, but cannot make out the reason of the proposed question. At last
he gives up. Upon this, the victorious Philosopher says: “You will soon
break the bow, if you always keep it bent; but if you loosen it, it will

She-Goats: “Simpleton, you are mistaken; your mother is not here;” and
pointed out some Sheep at a distance, in a flock by themselves.
“I&nbsp;am not looking for her,” <i>said the Lamb</i>, “who, when she
thinks fit, conceives, then carries her unknown burden for a certain
number of months, and at last empties out the fallen bundle; but for her
who, presenting her udder, nourishes me, and deprives her young ones of
milk that I may not go without.” “Still,” said the Dog, “she ought to be
preferred who brought you forth.” “Not at all: how was she to know

THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE OWL.</h4>

<p>He who does not conform to courtesy, mostly pays the penalty of his
superciliousness.</p>

<p>A Grasshopper was making a chirping that was disagreeable to an Owl,
who was wont to seek her living in the dark, and in the day-time to take
her rest in a hollow tree. She was asked to cease her noise, but she
began much more loudly to send forth her note; entreaties urged again
only set her on still more. The Owl, when she saw she had no remedy, and
that her words were slighted, attacked the chatterer with this
stratagem: “As your song, which one might take for the tones of Apollo’s
lyre, will not allow me to go to sleep, I&nbsp;have a mind to drink some
nectar which Pallas lately gave me;<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_37"

soon as she found her voice complimented, eagerly flew up. The Owl,
coming forth from her hollow, seized the trembling thing, and put her to
death.</p>

ÆSOP’S ANSWER TO THE INQUISITIVE MAN.</h4>

<p>When Æsop was the only servant of his master, he was ordered to
prepare dinner earlier than usual. Accordingly, he went round to several
houses, seeking for fire,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_40" id =

<p>There are yet remaining <i>Fables</i> for me to write, but I
purposely abstain; first, that I may not seem troublesome to you, whom a
multiplicity of matters distract; and next, that, if perchance any other
person is desirous to make a like attempt, he may still have something
left to do; although there is so abundant a stock of matter that an
artist will be wanting to the work, not work to the artist.
I&nbsp;request that you will give the reward to my brevity which you
promised; make good your word. For life each day is nearer unto death;
and the greater the time that is wasted in delays, the less the
advantage that will accrue to me. If you dispatch the matter quickly,
the more lasting will be <i>my</i> enjoyment; the sooner I receive

there is room for <i>your</i> goodness; in aftertimes your kindness will
in vain endeavour to aid me, infirm with old age; for then I shall have
ceased to be able to enjoy your kindness, and death, close at hand, will
be claiming its due. I&nbsp;deem it foolish to address my entreaties to
you, when your compassion is so ready, spontaneously, to render
assistance. A&nbsp;criminal has often gained pardon by confessing; how

<i>Eutychus</i>)&mdash;Ver. 2. It is not known with certainty who this
Eutychus was to whom he addresses himself. It has been suggested that he
is the same person who is mentioned by Josephus, Antiq. B.&nbsp;xix.,
c.&nbsp;4, as flourishing at the Court of Caligula, and who had
previously been a charioteer and inspector of buildings at the stables
of Claudius. He is also supposed, from the words of the Epilogue of this
Book, line 20-26, to have held more than one public office. It has been
suggested that he was the freedman of the Emperor Claudius or Augustus,
an inscription having been found in the tomb of the freedmen of the
latter to C. Julius Eutychus. But it is hardly probable that he is the
person meant; as there is little doubt that Phædrus wrote the present
Book of Fables long after the time of Augustus. Indeed it has been
suggested by some that he wrote it as late as the reign of Caligula.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_2" id = "noteIII_2" href = "#tagIII_2">2.</a>
<i>Some holidays</i>)&mdash;Ver. 8. The Romans had three kinds of public
“feriæ,” or holidays, which all belonged to the “dies nefasti,” or days
on which no public business could be done. These were the “feriæ
stativæ,” “conceptivæ,” and “imperativæ.” The first were held regularly,
and on stated days set forth in the Calendar. To these belonged the
Lupercalia, Carmentalia, and Agonalia. The “conceptivæ,” or “conceptæ,”
were moveable feasts held at certain seasons in every year, but not on
fixed days; the times for holding them being annually appointed by the
magistrates or priests. Among these were the “feriæ Latinæ,” Sementivæ,
Paganalia, and Compitalia. The “<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘feræ’">feriæ</ins> imperativæ” were appointed to be held on
certain emergencies by order of the Consuls, Prætors, and Dictators; and
were in general held to avert national calamities or to celebrate great
victories.</p>

<i>Worthless ditties</i>)&mdash;Ver. 10. “Nænia” were, properly, the
improvised songs that were sung at funerals by the hired mourners, who
were generally females. From their trivial nature, the word came to be
generally applied to all worthless ditties, and under this name Phædrus,
with all humility, alludes to his Fables.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_4" id = "noteIII_4" href = "#tagIII_4">4.</a>
<i>On the Pierian Hill</i>)&mdash;Ver. 17. Judging from this passage it
would appear that Phædrus was a Macedonian by birth, and not, as more
generally stated, a&nbsp;Thracian. Pieria was a country on the
south-east coast of Macedonia, through which ran a ridge of mountains,
a&nbsp;part of which were called Pieria, or the Pierian mountain. The
inhabitants are celebrated in the early history of the music and poesy
of Greece, as their country was one of the earliest seats of the worship
of the Muses, and Orpheus was said to have been buried there. It is most
probable that Phædrus was carried away in slavery to Rome in his early
years, and that he remembered but little of his native country.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_5" id = "noteIII_5" href = "#tagIII_5">5.</a>
<i>As Sinon said</i>)&mdash;Ver. 27. He here alludes to the words of
Sinon, the Grecian spy, when brought before Priam, in the Second Book of
Virgil, 77-78:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Cuncta equidem tibi, rex, fuerit quodcumque fatebor</p>

</div>

<p>Others, again, suppose that this was a proverbial expression in

being adopted from the work of Virgil: “Come what may of it, as Sinon
said.”</p>

<i>To my own misfortune</i>)&mdash;Ver. 40. He evidently alludes to some
misfortune which has befallen him in consequence of having alluded in
his work to the events of his own times. It has been suggested that he
fell under the displeasure of Tiberius and his minister Sejanus, in
consequence of the covert allusions made to them in Fables II and VI in
the First Book. This question is, however, involved in impenetrable
obscurity.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_9" id = "noteIII_9" href = "#tagIII_9">9.</a>
<i>Than Sejanus</i>)&mdash;Ver. 41. He means that Ælius Sejanus had
acted against him as both informer, witness, and judge; but that had an
honest man condemned him to the sufferings he then experienced, he
should not have complained. The nature of the punishment here alluded to
is not known.</p>

<i>Falernian <ins class = "correction" title = "not capitalized in body text">Lees</ins></i>)&mdash;Ver. 2. The Falernian wine held the second
rank in estimation among the Romans. The territory where it was grown
commenced at the “Pons Campanus,” and extended from the Massic Hills to
the river Vulturnus. Pliny mentions three kinds, the rough, the sweet,
and the thin. It is supposed to have been of an amber colour, and of
considerable strength. It was the custom to write the age of the wine
and the vintage on the “amphora,” or cask.</p>

applies to the savour or smell of the wine; though some Commentators
have thought that she addresses the cask as “anima,” meaning “O dear
soul;” others, that she speaks of the wine as being the soul of life;
while Walchius seems to think that she is addressing her own soul, which
is quite cheered by the fumes.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_15" id = "noteIII_15" href = "#tagIII_15">15.</a>
<i>Who knows me</i>)&mdash;Ver. 7. Burmann thinks that the author
covertly hints here at the habits of the Emperor Tiberius in his old
age, who still hankered after those vicious indulgences which had been
his main pursuits in his former days; or else that the Poet simply
refers to human life, in the same spirit in which Seneca, Ep. lvii.,
calls old age, “fæx vitæ,” “the lees of life.” Others again suppose that
Phædrus alludes to his own old age, and means that those who knew him
when this Fable was written, may judge from their present acquaintance
with him what he must have been in his younger days. Heinsius thinks
that it refers to the present state of servitude of Phædrus, compared
with his former liberty; but, if he was manumitted, as generally
supposed<ins class = "correction" title = "comma missing">,&nbsp;</ins>by Augustus, and this Fable was not written till
after the death of Sejanus, that cannot be the case.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_16" id = "noteIII_16" href = "#tagIII_16">16.</a>
<i>A Panther</i>)&mdash;Ver. 2. Some have suggested, Burmann and Guyetus
in the number, that by the Panther is meant Tiberius, who, during his
banishment to the isle of Rhodes, occupied himself in studying how to
wreak his vengeance upon his enemies at Rome, and, with the fury of the
Panther, as soon as he had the opportunity, glutted his vengeance. This
notion, however, seems more ingenious than well founded.</p>

<i>How it might taste</i>)&mdash;Ver. 3. The Butcher puns upon the
twofold meaning of “sapio,” “to taste of,” or “have a flavour,” and “to
be wise.” The customer uses the word in the former sense, while the
Butcher answers it in the latter, and perhaps in the former as well;
“Such as the head is,” pointing to it, “I’ll warrant the wisdom of the
animal to be;” the words at the same time bearing the meaning of, “It
has an ape’s head, and therefore it can only taste like the head of an
ape.” “Sapor” ordinarily means “flavour,” or “taste;” but Cicero uses it
in the signification of wisdom or genius. Many other significations of
this passage have been suggested by the various Editors.</p>

soft or easy chair used in the “gynæcæa,” or women’s apartments. These
were of various forms and sizes, and had backs to them; it was
considered effeminate for the male sex to use them. “Sellæ” was the name
of seats common to both sexes. The use of the “speculum,” or mirror, was
also confined to the female sex; indeed, even Pallas or Minerva was
represented as shunning its use, as only befitting her more voluptuous
fellow-goddess, Venus.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_24" id = "noteIII_24" href = "#tagIII_24">24.</a>
<i>I might be acquitted</i>)&mdash;Ver. 4. He alludes to the fate of
Socrates, who, after he was put to death by his countrymen, was publicly
pronounced to be innocent, and a statue was erected in his honour.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_25" id = "noteIII_25" href = "#tagIII_25">25.</a>
<i>Met his death</i>)&mdash;Ver. 3. The story of Hippolytus, who met his
death in consequence of the treachery of his step-mother Phædra, is
related at length in the Play of Euripides of that name, and in the
Fifteenth Book of Ovid’s Metamorphoses. The fate of Cassandra, the
daughter of Priam, who in vain prophesied the fall of Troy, is related
in the Second Book of the Æneid, l.&nbsp;246, <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_26" id = "noteIII_26" href = "#tagIII_26">26.</a>
<i>The white toga</i>)&mdash;Ver. 10. The “toga prætexta,” or Consular
robe, was worn by the male children of the Romans till their sixteenth
year; when they assumed the ordinary “toga,” which was called “pura,”
because it had no purple border, and was entirely white.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_27" id = "noteIII_27" href = "#tagIII_27">27.</a>
<i>The hair cut close</i>)&mdash;Ver. 27. This is appropriately
introduced, as the hair of youths was allowed to grow long until they
had reached the age of manhood, on which it was cut close, and
consecrated to the Gods.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_28" id = "noteIII_28" href = "#tagIII_28">28.</a>
<i>The Centumviri</i>)&mdash;Ver. 35. The “Centumviri” were a body of
105 officers, whose duty it was to assist the prætor in litigated
questions. They were sometimes called “judices selecti,” or
“commissioned judges.”</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_29" id = "noteIII_29" href = "#tagIII_29">29.</a>
<i>The patrons stand</i>)&mdash;Ver. 37. The patrons stood while
pleading the causes of their clients, while the judges sat, as with
us.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_30" id = "noteIII_30" href = "#tagIII_30">30.</a>
<i>Sure source of truth</i>)&mdash;Ver. 43. It is suggested that the
source of information here alluded to was the evidence of the slaves,
who had heard their master mention in his last moments the treachery of
his freedman. It is not probable that the freedman voluntarily came
forward, and declared the truth to Augustus. In l.&nbsp;39, Augustus is
called “Divus,” as having been deified after his death. Domitian was the
first who was so called during his lifetime.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_31" id = "noteIII_31" href = "#tagIII_31">31.</a>
<i>Deserved to suffer</i>)&mdash;Ver. 7. Though this moral may apply to
all misfortunes in general, it is supposed by some of the Commentators
that by the insulter some individual notorious for his adulteries was
intended to be represented; who consequently merited by law to be
reduced to the same situation as the innocent Eunuch.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_32" id = "noteIII_32" href = "#tagIII_32">32.</a>
<i>Have no relish for me</i>)&mdash;Ver. 8. From this passage we may
infer either that Phædrus himself had many censurers at Rome, or that
the people in general were not admirers of Fables.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_33" id = "noteIII_33" href = "#tagIII_33">33.</a>
<i>The proposed stipulation</i>)&mdash;Ver. 17. It has been suggested
that Phædrus here alludes to some who had laid claim to the authorship
of his Fables, and had refused a challenge given by him, such as that
here given to the Drones, to test the correctness of their
assertions.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_34" id = "noteIII_34" href = "#tagIII_34">34.</a>
<i>At play with nuts</i>)&mdash;Ver. 2. It is thought by Schwabe that
Phædrus wrote this Fable in defence of his early patron Augustus,
against those who censured him for the levity of his conduct in his old
age, as we learn from Suetonius that he amused himself with fishing,
playing with dice, pebbles, or nuts with boys. &mdash;For some account
of Roman games with nuts, see “The Walnut-tree,” a&nbsp;fragment of
Ovid, in vol. iii. p.&nbsp;491, of Bohn’s Translation of that
author.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_35" id = "noteIII_35" href = "#tagIII_35">35.</a>
<i>To a Lamb</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1. Burmann suggests that this Fable is
levelled against the cruelty of parents, who were much in the habit of
exposing their children, who were consequently far from indebted to
them. Schwabe conjectures that the system of employing wet-nurses is
intended here to be censured.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_36" id = "noteIII_36" href = "#tagIII_36">36.</a>
<i>Black or white</i>)&mdash;Ver. 10. This, though disregarded by the
mother, would be of importance to him, as the black lambs were first
selected for sacrifice.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_37" id = "noteIII_37" href = "#tagIII_37">37.</a>
<i>Pallas lately gave me</i>)&mdash;Ver. 13. The Owl was sacred to
Pallas.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_38" id = "noteIII_38" href = "#tagIII_38">38.</a>
<i>So heaven help me</i>)&mdash;Ver. 8. “Mehercule,” literally “By
Hercules.” This was a form of oath used generally by men, and Phædrus
has been censured for here putting it in the mouth of Minerva. Some
Commentators also think that he is guilty of a slight anachronism in
using the name of Hercules here to give emphasis to an asseveration; but
there does not appear to be any ground for so thinking, as the choice
must, of course, be supposed to have been made after his death and
deification. In the Amphitryon of Plautus, Mercury is represented as
swearing by Hercules before that God was born.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_39" id = "noteIII_39" href = "#tagIII_39">39.</a>
<i>Vain is our glory</i>)&mdash;Ver. 12. “Nisi utile est quod facimus,
stulta est gloria.” This line is said to have been found copied on a
marble stone, as part of a sepulchral inscription, at Alba Julia or
Weissenburg, in Transylvania.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_40" id = "noteIII_40" href = "#tagIII_40">40.</a>
<i>Seeking for fire</i>)&mdash;Ver. 3. Fire was kindled in general by
being kept smouldering in a log under the ashes, from day to day, for
culinary purposes; or else it was begged from a neighbour, as we learn
from the Aulularia of Plautus, A.&nbsp;I., Sc.&nbsp;ii., l.&nbsp;12
<i>et seq.</i>; and so generally was this done that we find it stated in
the Trinummus, A.&nbsp;II., sc.&nbsp;ii., l.&nbsp;53, that it was the
custom not to refuse fire when asked for even to an enemy.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_41" id = "noteIII_41" href = "#tagIII_41">41.</a>
<i>In search of a man</i>)&mdash;Ver 9. Meaning that he did not deem the
enquirer to be a man. The same story is told in Diogenes Laertius, of
Diogenes the Cynic.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_42" id = "noteIII_42" href = "#tagIII_42">42.</a>
This and the following Prologue seem better suited to their present
places than to the close of the Fourth Book, where in most of the
editions they appear.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_43" id = "noteIII_43" href = "#tagIII_43">43.</a>
<i>Of a wearied life</i>)&mdash;Ver. 15. It is impossible to say with
any certainty to what he refers; but the most probable conjecture is
that he has again got into trouble through his compositions, and is
begging Eutychus, in some public capacity, immediately to give a
favourable decision in his behalf. That “Languens ævum” means a life
worn out with misfortune, and does not refer to himself as sinking, in
want, under old age, is evident from the next line. It has been
conjectured by some that Phædrus wrote these lines in prison, where he
had been thrown through the malice of his enemies.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_44" id = "noteIII_44" href = "#tagIII_44">44.</a>
<i>It is your province</i>)&mdash;Ver. 24. He is supposed to allude to
some judicial position held by Eutychus, which he would have to vacate
at the end of a year, and be succeeded by others, probably not so
favourably disposed to himself.</p>

<p><a name = "noteIII_45" id = "noteIII_45" href = "#tagIII_45">45.</a>
<i>To murmur in public</i>)&mdash;Ver. 33. “Palam mutire plebeio
piaculum est.” These words are quoted from the Telephus of Ennius.</p>

THE WEASEL AND THE MICE.</h4>

<p>This way of writing seems to you facetious; and no doubt, while we
have nothing of more importance, we do sport with the pen. But examine
these Fables with attention, <i>and</i> what useful lessons will you
find <i>concealed</i> under them! Things are not always what they seem;
first appearances deceive many: few minds understand what skill has
hidden in an inmost corner. That I may not appear to have said this
without reason, I&nbsp;will add a Fable about the Weasel and the
Mice.</p>

<p>A Weasel, worn out with years and old age, being unable to overtake
the active Mice, rolled herself in flour, and threw herself carelessly
along in a dark spot. A&nbsp;Mouse, thinking her food, jumped upon her,
and, being caught, was put to death:
<span class = "pagenum">411</span>
another in like manner perished, and then a third. Some others having
followed, an <i>old</i> brindled fellow came, who had escaped snares and
mouse-traps full oft; and viewing from afar the stratagem of the crafty
foe: “So fare you well,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_6" id = "tagIV_6"
href = "#noteIV_6">IV.6</a>” said he, “you that are lying there, as you

like to eat them while sour.”</p>

<p>Those who disparage what they cannot perform, ought to apply this
lesson to themselves.</p>

THE HORSE AND THE WILD BOAR.</h4>

<p>While a Wild Boar was wallowing, he muddied the shallow water, at
which a Horse had been in the habit of quenching his thirst. Upon this,
a&nbsp;disagreement arose. The Horse,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_7"
id = "tagIV_7" href = "#noteIV_7">IV.7</a> enraged with the beast,
sought the aid of man, and, raising him on his back, returned against
the foe. After the Horseman, hurling his javelins, had slain <i>the
Boar</i>, he is said to have spoken thus: “I&nbsp;am glad that I gave
assistance at your entreaties, for I have captured a prey, and have
learned how useful you are;” and so compelled him, unwilling as he was,
to submit to the rein. Then <i>said the Horse</i>, sorrowing: “Fool that
I am! while seeking to revenge a trifling matter, I&nbsp;have met with
slavery.”</p>

<p>This Fable will admonish the passionate, that it is better to be
injured with impunity, than to put ourselves in the power of
another.</p>

ÆSOP INTERPRETING A WILL.</h4>

<p>I will show to posterity, by a short story, that there is often more
merit in one man than in a multitude.</p>

<p>A Person, at his death, left three Daughters; one handsome, and
hunting for the men with her eyes; the second, an industrious spinner of
wool,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_8" id = "tagIV_8" href =
"#noteIV_8">IV.8</a> frugal, and fond of a country life; the third,
given to wine, and very ugly. Now the old man made their Mother his
heir, on this condition, that she should distribute his whole fortune
equally among the three, but in such a manner that they should not
possess or enjoy what was given them; <i>and</i> further, that as soon
as they should cease to have the property which they had received, they
should pay over to their Mother a hundred thousand sesterces. The rumour
spreads all over Athens. The anxious Mother consults the learned in the
law. No one can explain in what way they are not to possess what has
been given, or have the enjoyment <i>of it</i>; and then again, in what
way those who have received nothing, are to pay money. After a long time
had been wasted, and still the meaning of the will could not be
understood, the Parent, disregarding the strict letter of the law,
consulted equity.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_9" id = "tagIV_9" href =
"#noteIV_9">IV.9</a> For the Wanton, she sets aside the garments, female
trinkets, silver bathing-vessels, eunuchs, <i>and</i> beardless boys:
for the Worker in wool, the fields, cattle, farm, labourers, oxen,
beasts of burden, and implements of husbandry: for the Drinker,
a&nbsp;store-room,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_10" id = "tagIV_10"
href = "#noteIV_10">IV.10</a> well stocked with casks of old
<span class = "pagenum">413</span>
wine, a&nbsp;finely finished house,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_11" id
= "tagIV_11" href = "#noteIV_11">IV.11</a> and delightful gardens. When
she was intending to distribute what was thus set apart for each, and
the public approved, who knew them well; Æsop suddenly stood up in the
midst of the multitude, <i>and exclaimed</i>: “O! if consciousness
remained to their buried father, how would he grieve that the people of
Athens are unable to interpret his will!”</p>

<p>On this, being questioned, he explained the error of them all: “The
house and the furniture, with the fine gardens, and the old wines, give
to the Worker in wool, so fond of a country life. The clothes, the
pearls, the attendants, and other things, make over to her who spends
her life in luxury. The fields, the vines, and the flocks, with the
shepherds, present to the Wanton. Not one will be able to retain
possession of what is alien to her taste. The Ungainly one will sell her
wardrobe to procure wine; the Wanton will part with the lands to procure
fine clothes; and she who delights in cattle, and attends to her
spinning, will get rid of her luxurious abode at any price. Thus, no one
will possess what was given, and they will pay to their Mother the sum
named from the price of the things, which each of them has sold.”</p>

<p>Thus did the sagacity of one man find out what had baffled the
superficial enquiries of many.</p>

<p>Would that the pine had never fallen on the summits of Pelion<a class
= "tag" name = "tagIV_14" id = "tagIV_14" href = "#noteIV_14">IV.14</a>
under the Thessalian axe! and that Argus had never, with the aid of
Pallas, invented a way boldly to meet certain death, <i>in the</i> ship
which, to the destruction of Greeks and Barbarians, first laid open the
bays of the inhospitable Euxine. For both had the house of the proud
Æetes to lament it, and the realms of Pelias<a class = "tag" name =

A THIEF PILLAGING THE ALTAR OF JUPITER.</h4>

<p>A Thief lighted his Lamp at the altar of Jupiter, and then plundered
it by the help of its own light. Just as he was taking his departure,
laden with the results of his sacrilege, the Holy Place suddenly sent
forth these words: “Although these were the gifts of the wicked, and to
me abominable, so much so that I care not to be spoiled of them, still,
profane man, thou shalt pay the penalty with thy life, when hereafter,
the day of punishment, appointed by fate, arrives. But, that our fire,
by means of which piety worships the awful Gods, may not afford its
light to crime, I&nbsp;forbid that <i>henceforth</i> there shall be any
such interchange of light.” Accordingly, to this day, it is neither
lawful for a lamp <i>to be lighted</i> at the fire of the Gods, nor yet
a sacrifice kindled from a lamp.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_20" id =

<span class = "pagenum">417</span>
<p>No other than he who invented this Fable, could explain how many
useful lessons it affords. In the first place, it teaches that those
whom you yourself have brought up, may often be found the most hostile
to you: then again, it shows that crimes are punished not through the
wrath of the Gods, but at the time appointed by the Fates: lastly, it
warns the good to use nothing in common with the wicked.</p>

THE EMBASSY OF THE DOGS TO JUPITER.</h4>

<p>The Dogs once sent<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_24" id = "tagIV_24"
href = "#noteIV_24">IV.24</a> Ambassadors to Jupiter, to entreat of him
a happier lot in life, and that he would deliver them from the insulting
treatment of man, who gave them bread mixed with bran, and satisfied
their most urgent hunger with filthy offal. The ambassadors set out,
<i>but</i> with no hasty steps, while snuffing with their nostrils for
food in every filth. Being summoned, they fail to make their appearance.
After some difficulty Mercury finds them at last, and brings them
<span class = "pagenum">420</span>
up in confusion. As soon, however, as they saw the countenance of mighty
Jove, in their fright they bewrayed the whole palace. Out they go,
driven away with sticks; but great Jove forbade that they should be sent
back. <i>The Dogs</i>, wondering that their Ambassadors did not return,
<i>and</i> suspecting that they had committed something disgraceful,
after a while ordered others to be appointed to aid them. Rumour
<i>soon</i> betrayed the former Ambassadors. Dreading that something of
a similar nature may happen a second time, they stuff the Dogs behind
with perfumes, and plenty of them. They give their directions; the
Ambassadors are dispatched; at once they take their departure. They beg
for an audience, <i>and</i> forthwith obtain it. Then did the most
mighty Father of the Gods take his seat <i>on his throne</i>, and
brandish his thunders; all things began to shake. The Dogs in alarm, so
sudden was the crash, in a moment let fall the perfumes with their dung.
All cry out, that the affront must be avenged. <i>But</i> before
proceeding to punishment, thus spoke Jupiter:&mdash; “It is not for a
King to send Ambassadors away, nor is it a difficult matter to inflict a
<i>proper</i> punishment on the offence; but by way of judgment this is
the reward you shall have. I&nbsp;don’t forbid their return, but they
shall be famished with hunger, lest they be not able to keep their

THE SHIPWRECK OF SIMONIDES.</h4>

<p>A learned man has always a fund of riches in himself.</p>

<p>Simonides, who wrote <i>such</i> excellent <i>lyric</i> poems, the
more easily to support his poverty, began to make a tour of the
celebrated cities of Asia, singing the praises of victors for such
reward as he might receive. After he had become enriched by this kind of
gain, he resolved to return to his
<span class = "pagenum">423</span>
native land by sea; (for he was born, it is said, in the island of
Ceos<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_32" id = "tagIV_32" href =
"#noteIV_32">IV.32</a>). <i>Accordingly</i> he embarked in a ship, which
a dreadful tempest, together with its own rottenness, caused to founder
at sea. Some gathered together their girdles,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIV_33" id = "tagIV_33" href = "#noteIV_33">IV.33</a> others their
precious effects, <i>which formed</i> the support of their existence.
One who was over inquisitive, <i>remarked</i>: “Are you going to save
none of your property, Simonides?” He made reply: “All my
<i>possessions</i> are about me.” A&nbsp;few <i>only</i> made their
escape by swimming, for the majority, being weighed down by their
burdens, perished. Some thieves make their appearance, and seize what
each person has saved, leaving them naked. Clazomenæ, an ancient city,
chanced to be near; to which the shipwrecked persons repaired. Here a
person devoted to the pursuits of literature, who had often read the
lines of Simonides, and was a very great admirer of him though he had
never seen him, knowing from his very language <i>who he was</i>,
received him with the greatest pleasure into his house, and furnished
him with clothes, money, and attendants. The others <i>meanwhile</i>
were carrying about their pictures,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_34" id

Simonides chanced to meet them; and, as soon as he saw them, remarked:

to save is lost.”</p>

THE ANT AND THE FLY.</h4>

<p>An Ant and a Fly were contending with great warmth which was of the
greater importance. The Fly was the first to begin: “Can you possibly
compare with my endowments? When a sacrifice is made, I&nbsp;am the
first to taste of the entrails that belong to the Gods. I&nbsp;pass my
time among the altars, I&nbsp;wander through all the temples; soon as I
have espied it, I&nbsp;seat myself on the head of a king; and I taste of
the chaste kisses of matrons. I&nbsp;labour not, and yet enjoy the
nicest of things: what like to this, <i>good</i> rustic, falls to your
lot?” “Eating with the Gods,” said the Ant, “is certainly a thing to be
boasted of; but by him who is invited, not him who is loathed <i>as an
intruder</i>. You talk about kings and the kisses of matrons. While I am
carefully heaping up a stock of grain for winter, I&nbsp;see you feeding
on filth about the walls. You frequent the altars; yes, and are driven
away as often as you come. You labour not; therefore it is that you have
nothing when you stand in need of it. And, further, you boast about what
modesty ought to conceal. You tease me in summer; when winter comes you
are silent. While the cold is shrivelling you up and putting you to
death, a&nbsp;well-stored abode harbours me. Surely I have now pulled
down your pride enough.”</p>

who set themselves off with unfounded praises, and of those whose
virtues gain solid fame.</p>

SIMONIDES PRESERVED BY THE GODS.</h4>

<p>I have said, above, how greatly learning is esteemed among men:
I&nbsp;will now hand down to posterity how great is the honor paid to it
by the Gods.</p>

<p>Simonides, the very same of whom I have <i>before</i> made mention,
agreed, at a fixed price, to write a panegyric for a certain Pugilist,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagIV_36" id = "tagIV_36" href =
"#noteIV_36">IV.36</a> who had been victorious: <i>accordingly</i> he
sought retirement. As the meagreness of his subject cramped his
imagination, he used, according to general custom, the license of the
Poet, and introduced the twin stars of Leda,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIV_37" id = "tagIV_37" href = "#noteIV_37">IV.37</a> citing them as
an example of similar honours. He finished the Poem according to
contract, but received <i>only</i> a third part of the sum agreed upon.
On his demanding the rest: “They,” said he, “will give it you whose
praises occupy <i>the other</i> two-thirds; but, that I may feel
convinced that you have not departed in anger, promise to dine with me,
<i>as</i> I intend to-day to invite my kinsmen, in the number of whom I
reckon you<ins class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">.”
</ins>Although defrauded, and smarting under the injury, in order that
he might not, by parting on bad terms, break off all friendly
intercourse, he promised that he would. At the hour named he returned,
<i>and</i> took his place at table. The banquet shone joyously with its
cups; the house resounded with gladness, amid vast preparations, when,
on a sudden, two young men, covered with dust, and dripping with
perspiration, their bodies of more than human form, requested one of the
servants to call Simonides to them, <i>and say</i> that it was of
consequence to him to make no delay. The man, quite confused, called
forth Simonides; <i>and</i> hardly had he put one foot out of the
banquetting room, when suddenly the fall of the ceiling crushed the
rest, and no young men were to be seen at the gate.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">426</span>

himself to point their moral in reference to individuals or classes, in

flowing robe, came with a mincing and languid step. As soon as the
Tyrant caught sight of him at the end of the train: “What effeminate
wretch,” said he, “is this, who presumes to come into my presence?”
Those near him made answer: “This is Menander the Poet.” Changed in an

<p>Two Soldiers having fallen in with a Robber, one fled, while the

more emboldened, believing them true; now keep your sword quiet, as well
as your silly tongue, that you may be able to deceive others who don’t

<p>A Fly bit the bare pate of a Bald Man; who, endeavouring to crush it,
gave himself a heavy blow. Then said the Fly jeeringly: “You wanted to
revenge the sting of a tiny insect with death; what will you do to
yourself, who have added insult to injury?” <i>The Man</i> made answer:
“I&nbsp;am easily reconciled to myself, because I know that there was no
intention of doing harm. But you, worthless insect, and one of a
contemptible race, who take a delight in drinking human blood,
I&nbsp;could wish to destroy you, even at a heavier penalty.”</p>

THE BUFFOON AND THE COUNTRYMAN.</h4>

<p>Men are in the habit of erring through prejudice; and
<span class = "pagenum">430</span>
while they stand up in defence of their erroneous notions, <i>are
wont</i> to be driven by plain facts to confession of their
mistakes.</p>

<p>A rich Man, about to entertain the people with grand shows, invited
all, by the promise of a reward, to exhibit whatever new piece of
ingenuity any one could. The Performers came to the contest for fame,
among whom a Buffoon, well known for his drollery, said that he had a
kind of entertainment which had never yet been brought out at <i>any</i>
theatre. The rumour, spreading, brought together the <i>whole</i> city;
and the places, empty shortly before, sufficed not for the multitude.
But as soon as he appeared on the stage, alone, <i>and</i> without any
apparatus, any stage-assistants, the very intenseness of expectation
produced silence. Suddenly, he dropped down his head towards his bosom,
and so well did he imitate the voice of a pig with his own, that they
concluded there was a real one under his cloak, and ordered it to be
shaken out. This being done, as soon as they found that nothing was
discovered, they loaded the Man with many praises, and bestowed upon him
the greatest applause.</p>

<p>A Countryman seeing this take place: “Egad,” said he, “he shan’t
surpass me;” and immediately gave out that he would do the same thing
still better on the following day. A&nbsp;still greater crowd assembled.
Prejudice had already taken possession of their minds, and they took
their seats, determined to deride, and not as <i>unbiassed</i>
spectators. Both Performers come forth. First, the Buffoon grunts away,
and excites their applause, and <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘awaken’">awakens</ins> their acclamations. Next, the Countryman,
pretending that he concealed a pig beneath his clothes (which, in fact,
he did; but quite unsuspected, because they had found none about the
other), twitched the ear of the real <i>pig</i>, which he was
concealing, and with the pain forced from it its natural cry. The people
shouted with one voice that the Buffoon had given a much more exact
imitation, and ordered the Countryman to be driven from the stage. On
this, he produced the pig itself from the folds of his cloak, and
convicting them of their disgraceful mistake by a manifest proof:
“Look,” said <i>he</i>, “this shows what sort of judges you are.”</p>

<p>A Bald Man chanced to find a comb in the public road. Another,

it is you have found.” The other showed the booty, and added withal:
“The will of the Gods has favoured us, but through the malignity of
fate, we have found, as the saying is, a&nbsp;coal instead of a
treasure.”</p>

PRINCEPS, THE FLUTE-PLAYER.</h4>

<p>When a weak mind, beguiled by frivolous applause, has once given way
to insolent self-sufficiency, <i>such</i> foolish vanity is easily
exposed to ridicule.</p>

<p>Princeps, the Flute-player, was pretty well known, being accustomed
to accompany Bathyllus<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_5" id = "tagV_5"
href = "#noteV_5">V.5</a> with his music on the stage. It chanced that,
at a representation, I&nbsp;don’t well remember what it was, while the
flying-machine<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_6" id = "tagV_6" href =
"#noteV_6">V.6</a> was being whirled along, he fell heavily, through
inadvertence, and broke his left leg, when he would much rather have
parted with two right ones.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_7" id =
"tagV_7" href = "#noteV_7">V.7</a> He was picked up and carried to his
house groaning aloud. Some months pass by before his cure is completed.
As is the way with the spectators, for <i>they are</i> a merry race, the
man began to be missed, by
<span class = "pagenum">432</span>
whose blasts the vigour of the dancer was wont to be kept at full
stretch.</p>

<p>A certain Nobleman was about to exhibit a show, just when Princeps
was beginning to walk abroad. With a present <i>and</i> entreaties he
prevailed upon him merely to present himself on the day of the show.
When the day came a rumour about the Flute-player ran through the
theatre. Some affirmed that he was dead, some that he would appear
before them without delay. The curtain falling,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_8" id = "tagV_8" href = "#noteV_8">V.8</a> the thunders rolled,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagV_9" id = "tagV_9" href = "#noteV_9">V.9</a>
and the Gods conversed in the usual form. At this moment the Chorus
struck up a song unknown to him who had so recently returned; of which
the burthen was this: “Rejoice, Rome, in security, for your prince
[<i>Princeps</i>] is well.” All rise with one consent and applaud. The
Flute-player kisses hands, <i>and</i> imagines that his friends are
congratulating him. The Equestrian order perceive the ridiculous
mistake, and with loud laughter encore the song. It is repeated. My man

stage.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_10" id = "tagV_10" href =

people fancy he is <i>only</i> asking for a chaplet. When, however, the

snow-white shoes,<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_11" id = "tagV_11" href =

actors, according to the present practice, it was depressed when the

MERCURY AND THE TWO WOMEN.</h4>

Another Fable on the same subject.</p>

<p>Once on a time, two Women had given their guest, Mercury, a&nbsp;mean
and sordid entertainment; one of the women had a little son in the
cradle, while the profession of a Courtesan had its charms for the
other. In order, therefore that he might give a suitable return for
their services, when about to depart, and just crossing the threshold,
he said: “In me you behold a God; I&nbsp;will give you at once whatever
each may wish.” The Mother makes her request, and asks that she may
immediately see her Son graced with a beard; the Courtesan
<i>requests</i> that whatever she touches may follow her. Mercury flies
away&mdash;the women return in-doors: behold

laugh heartily at this, on which the humours <i>of the head</i> filled
her nostrils, as is often the case. Intending therefore to blow her
nose, she seized it with her hand, and drew out its length to the
ground; and <i>thus</i>, while laughing at another, she became herself a

PROMETHEUS AND CUNNING.</h4>

<p class = "moral">
On Truth and Falsehood.</p>

<p>When once Prometheus, the framer of a new race, had formed Truth from
fine earth, that she might be able to dispense justice among mankind,
being suddenly summoned by the messenger of great Jove, he left
<i>his</i> workshop in charge of treacherous Cunning, whom he had lately
received in apprenticeship. The latter, inflamed by zeal, with clever
hand formed an image of similar appearance, corresponding stature, and
like in every limb, so far as the time permitted. When nearly the whole
had now been wondrously set up, he found he had no clay to make the
feet. <i>His</i> master came back, and Cunning, confused by fear at his
quick return, sat down in his own place. Prometheus, admiring so strong
a resemblance, wished the merit to appear to belong to his own skill,
<i>and</i> therefore placed the two images together in the furnace. When
they were thoroughly baked, and life had been breathed into them,
hallowed Truth moved on with modest gait; but her imperfect copy
remained fixed on the spot. Thence the spurious image, the result of the
stealthy work, was called Mendacity,<a class = "tag" name = "tagNF_4" id

How difficult it is to understand a man.</p>

<p>A Soldier of Pompeius Magnus, a man of huge bulk, by talking
mincingly and walking with an affected gait, had acquired the character
of an effeminate wretch, <i>and that</i> most fully established. Lying
in wait by night for the beasts of burden of his General, he drives away
the mules <i>laden</i> with garments and gold, and a vast weight of
silver. A&nbsp;rumour of what has been done gets abroad; the soldier is
accused, <i>and</i> carried off to the Prætorium. On this, Magnus
<i>says to him</i>: “How say you? Have you dared to rob me, comrade?”
The soldier forthwith spits into his left hand, and scatters about the
spittle with his fingers. “Even thus, General,” says he, “may my eyes
drip out, if I have seen or touched <i>your property</i>.” Then Magnus,
a&nbsp;man of easy disposition, orders the false accusers to be sent

to meet <i>the champion</i>, whose head, to the surprise of the army, he
whipped off sooner than you could say it, and returned victorious.
Thereupon said Pompeius: “With great pleasure I present you with the
soldier’s crown, because you have vindicated the honor of the Roman

<i>Attributed to Phædrus</i>)&mdash;Cassito and Jannelli, with several
other critics, are strongly of opinion that these Fables were written by
Phædrus. On a critical examination, however, they will be found to be so
dissimilar in style and language from those acknowledged to be by
Phædrus, that it is very difficult not to come to the conclusion that
they are the work of some more recent writer, of inferior genius, and
less pure latinity. They were first published in 1809, at Naples, by
Cassito, from a MS. which had belonged to Nicholas Perotti, Archbishop
of Sipontum or Manfredonia, at the end of the fifteenth century, and
who, notwithstanding his assertions to the contrary, was perhaps either
the author of them or altered them very materially. They appear in the
MSS. in a mutilated condition; and the lacunæ have been filled up
according to the fancy of the successive Editors of the Fables. Those
inserted in Gail’s edition have in general been here adopted.</p>

intended upon the word “menda,” a&nbsp;blemish<ins class = "correction"

blemished in having no feet, she was called “mendacium” or “mendacity.”
Here the author’s etymology is at fault, as the word “mendacity” comes
from “mentior,” to lie; which is not likely to have been derived from
“menda.” Besides, Falsehood, whether she has feet or not, generally
travels more speedily than Truth.</p>

<i>Having been guilty</i>)&mdash;Ver. 5. Chambry, one of the French
Editors, omits this, as unworthy of Phædrus, and Adry pronounces it
unintelligible. The meaning of this, which is Jannelli’s version, seems
to be: “When you ought not to please yourself, you do please yourself,
in committing the crime; but the consequence is that, afterwards, when
you ought to feel pleased, in that you have gratified your desires, you
cannot, in consequence of your guilty conscience.” It is so mutilated,
however, that Cassitti, Jannelli, and other Editors give entirely
different versions.</p>

<i>Injury to this field</i>)&mdash;Ver. 4. The Hare is more an enemy to
the flowers in gardens than to the fields. It was probably for this

<p><a name = "noteNF_22" id = "noteNF_22" href = "#tagNF_22">22.</a>
<i>Name of a God</i>)&mdash;Ver. 3. This pun upon the <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘resesemblance’">resemblance</ins> of
“Castor,” the name of the demigod, to “Castor,” “a&nbsp;beaver,” seems
to be a puerile pun; and the remark upon the limited “copia verborum” of
the Greeks, seems more likely to proceed from the Archbishop of Sipontum
than from Phædrus, who was evidently proud of his Grecian origin.</p>

<p><a name = "noteNF_23" id = "noteNF_23" href = "#tagNF_23">23.</a>
<i>A Butterfly</i>)&mdash;Ver. 1. This Fable is in a sadly mutilated
state, and critics are at a loss to say, with any certainty, what is
meant by it. Whether the supposed word in l.&nbsp;2, “barathris,” (if
really the correct reading), means the depths of hell, or the inner
folds of the leaves in which the Butterfly is enveloped in the chrysalis
state, or whether it means something else, will probably always remain a
matter of doubt. However, the Fable seems to allude to the prevalent
idea, that the soul, when disengaged from the body, took the form of a
butterfly. Indeed the Greeks called both the soul and a butterfly by the
name of <span class = "greek" title = "psuchê (printed with misplaced accent)">ψυχή</span>. There are six or seven different versions of the
first five lines.</p>

<p><a name = "noteNF_24" id = "noteNF_24" href = "#tagNF_24">24.</a>
<i>Ashes do I fly</i>)&mdash;Ver. 6. It is just possible that this may
allude to the soul being disengaged from the corruption of the body.</p>

<p><a name = "noteNF_25" id = "noteNF_25" href = "#tagNF_25">25.</a>
<i>Who were a Mule</i>)&mdash;Ver. 7. She would seem here to allude to
the doctrine of the transmigration of souls. It may possibly have been a
notion, that as the human soul took the form of a Butterfly, the souls
of animals appeared in the shapes of Wasps and Flies.</p>

<p>While a Lion was asleep in a wood, where some Field-Mice were

The Lion awoke and seized the wretched <i>creature</i> with a sudden
spring. The captive implored pardon <i>and</i> suppliantly confessed his
crime, a&nbsp;sin of imprudence. The Monarch, not deeming it a glorious
thing to exact vengeance for this, pardoned him and let him go.
A&nbsp;few days after, the Lion, while roaming by night, fell into a
trap. When he perceived that he was caught in the snare, he began to
roar with his loudest voice. At this tremendous noise the Mouse
instantly ran to his assistance, and exclaimed: “You have no need to
fear; I&nbsp;will make an adequate return for your great kindness.”
Immediately he began to survey all the knots and the fastenings of the
knots; and
<span class = "pagenum">456</span>
gnawing the strings after he had examined them, loosened the snare. Thus
did the Mouse restore the captured Lion to the woods.</p>

While he was selecting such as he thought fit, the Oak is reported thus

Frog dived suddenly, trying to reach the bottom, that she might

abounded with the choicest things. Here, while they were enjoying
remnants of various kinds, the door is thrown open, and in comes the
Butler; the Mice, terrified at the noise, fly in different directions,

and the City one easily hides himself in his well-known holes; while the
unfortunate Rustic, all trepidation in that strange house, and dreading
death, runs to-and-fro along the walls. When the Butler had taken what
he wanted, and had shut the door, the City Mouse bade the Country one
again to take courage. The latter, still in a state of perturbation,
replied: “I&nbsp;hardly can take any food for fear. Do you think he will
come?” &mdash;“Why are you in such a fright?” said the City one; “come,
let us enjoy dainties which you may seek in vain in the country.” The
Countryman <i>replied</i>: “You, who don’t know what it is to fear, will
enjoy all these things; but, free from care and at liberty, may acorns
be my food!”</p>

THE ASS FAWNING UPON HIS MASTER.</h4>

<p>An Ass, seeing the Dog fawn upon his master, and how he was crammed
at his table each day, and had bits thrown to him in abundance by the
Servants, thus remarked: “If the Master and the Servants are so very
fond of a most filthy Dog, what must it be with me, if I should pay him
similar attentions, who am much better than this Dog, and useful and
praiseworthy in many respects; who am supported by the pure streams of
undefiled water, and never in the habit of feeding upon nasty food?
Surely I am more worthy than a whelp to enjoy a happy life, and to
obtain the highest honor.” While the Ass is thus soliloquising, he sees
his Master enter the stable; so running up to him in haste and braying
aloud, he leaps upon him, claps both feet on his shoulders, begins to
lick his face; and tearing his clothes with his dirty hoofs, he fatigues
his Master with his heavy weight, as he stupidly fawns upon him. At
their Master’s outcry the Servants run to the spot, and seizing
everywhere such sticks and stones as come in their way, they punish the
braying <i>beast</i>, and knocking him off his Master’s body, soon send
him back, half-dead to the manger, with sore limbs and battered
rump.</p>

THE CRANE, THE CROW, AND THE COUNTRYMAN.</h4>

<p>A Crane and a Crow had made a league on oath, that the Crane should
protect the Crow against the Birds, <i>and</i> that the Crow should
foretell the future, so that the Crane might be on her guard. After
this, on their frequently flying into the fields of a certain
Countryman, and tearing up by the roots what had been sown, the owner of
the field saw it, and being vexed, cried out: “Give me a stone, Boy,
that I may hit the Crane.” When the Crow heard this, at once she warned
the Crane, who took all due precaution. On another day, too, the Crow
hearing him ask for a stone, again warned the Crane carefully to avoid
the danger. The Countryman, suspecting that the divining Bird heard his
commands, said to the Boy: “If I say, give me a cake, do you secretly
hand me a stone.” The Crane came <i>again</i>; he bade the Boy give him
a cake, but the Boy gave him a stone, with which he hit the Crane, and
broke her legs. The Crane, on being wounded, said: “Prophetic Crow,
where now are your auspices? Why did you not hasten to warn your
companion, as you swore you would, that no such evil might befall me?”
The Crow made answer: “It is not my art that deserves to be blamed; but
the purposes of double-tongued people are so deceiving, who say one
thing and do another.”</p>

and thus addressed them: “Danger awaits us all from this, if the seed
should come to maturity.” The Birds laughed <i>at her</i>. When the
crop, however, sprang up, the Swallow again remarked: “Our destruction
is impending; come, let us root up the noxious blades, lest, if they
shortly grow up, nets may be made thereof, and we may be taken by the
contrivances of man.” The Birds persist in laughing at the words of the
Swallow, and foolishly despise <i>this</i> most prudent advice. But she,
in her caution, at once betook herself to Man, that she might suspend
her nest in safety under his rafters. The Birds, however, who had
disregarded her wholesome advice, being caught in nets made of the flax,

these words, mingled with loud cries: “O&nbsp;Fox, I&nbsp;beseech you,

THE ASS, THE OX, AND THE BIRDS.</h4>

<p>An Ass and an Ox, fastened to the same yoke, were drawing a waggon.
While the Ox was pulling with all his might he broke his horn. The Ass
swears that he experiences no help whatever from his weak companion.
Exerting himself in the labour, the Ox breaks his other horn, and at
length falls dead upon the ground. Presently, the Herdsman loads the Ass
with the flesh of the Ox, and he breaks down amid a thousand blows, and
stretched in the middle of the road, expires. The Birds flying to the
prey, exclaim: “If you had shown yourself compassionate to the Ox when
he entreated you, you would not have been food for us through your
untimely death.”</p>

in his lap, and, taking out the thorn, relieves <i>the patient’s</i>
severe pain: whereupon the Lion returns to the woods. Some time after,
the Shepherd (being accused on a false charge) is condemned, and is

<p>While a Hawk was sitting in a Nightingale’s nest, on the watch for a
Hare, he found there some young ones. The Mother, alarmed at the danger
of her offspring, flew up, and suppliantly entreated him to spare her
young ones. “I&nbsp;will do what you wish,” he replied, “if you will
sing me a tuneful song with a clear voice.” On this, much as her heart
failed her, still, through fear, she obeyed, and being compelled, full

<p>A Wolf, in the course of time, had collected a store in his den, that
he might have food, which he might enjoy at his ease for many months.
A&nbsp;Fox, on learning this, went to the Wolf’s den, and <i>said</i>
with tremulous voice: “Is all right, brother? For not having seen you on
the look-out for prey in your woods, life has been saddened every day.”
The Wolf, when he perceived the envy of his rival, <i>replied</i>: “You
have not come hither from any anxiety on my account, but that you may
get a share. I&nbsp;know what is your deceitful aim.” The Fox enraged,
comes to a Shepherd, <i>and</i> says: “Shepherd, will you return me
thanks, if to-day I deliver up to you the enemy of your flock, so that
you need have no more anxiety?” The Shepherd <i>replied</i>:
“I&nbsp;will serve you, and will with pleasure give you anything you
like.” She points out the Wolf’s den to the Shepherd, who shuts him in,
despatches him immediately with a spear, and gladly gratifies his rival
with the property of another. When, however, the Fox had fallen into the
Hunter’s hands, being caught and mangled by the Dogs, she said: “Hardly
have I done an injury to another, ere I am now punished

Dogs, and receive as hostages the whelps of the Wolves. The Sheep,
hoping that lasting concord would be thus secured, did as the Wolves
demanded. Shortly after, when the whelps began to howl, the Wolves,
alleging as a pretext, that their young ones were being murdered, and
that the peace had been broken by the Sheep, made a simultaneous rush on
every side, and attacked the latter <i>thus</i> deprived of protectors;
<i>and</i> so a late repentance condemned their folly in putting faith
in their enemies.</p>

<p>An Ape asked a Fox to spare him some part of her exceeding length of
tail, with which he might be enabled to cover his most unseemly hinder
parts. “For of what use,” said he, “is a tail of such extraordinary
length? For what purpose do you drag such a vast weight along the
ground?” The Fox <i>answered</i>: “Even if it were longer, and much

<p>“Don’t fear,” the Shepherd replied; “I’ll point in another
direction.” Soon after, the Huntsman comes up in haste: “Shepherd, have
you not seen a Wolf come this way? Which way did he run?” The Shepherd
replied, in a loud voice: “He certainly did come, but he fled to the
left,” but he secretly motioned with his eyes towards the right. The
other did not understand him, and went on in haste. Then <i>said</i> the
Shepherd to the Wolf: “What thanks will you give me for having concealed
you?” “To your tongue, I&nbsp;give especial ones,” said the Wolf, “but
on your deceitful eyes I pray that the darkness of eternal night may

THE TRUTHFUL MAN, THE LIAR, AND THE APES.</h4>

<p>A Liar and a Truthful Man, while travelling together, chanced to come
into the land of the Apes. One of the number, who had made himself King,
seeing them, ordered them to be detained, that he might learn what men
said of him, <i>and</i> at the same time he ordered all the Apes to
stand in lengthened array on the right and left; and that a throne
should be placed for himself, as he had formerly seen was the practice
with the Kings among men. After this he questions the men <i>so</i>
ordered to be brought before him: “What do you think of me, strangers?”
“You seem to be a most mighty King,” the Liar replied. “What of these
whom you see now about me?” “These are ministers,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagAF_7" id = "tagAF_7" href = "#noteAF_7">AF.7</a> these are
lieutenants, and leaders of troops.” The Ape thus lyingly praised,
together with his crew, orders a present to be given to the flatterer.
On this the Truth-teller <i>remarked</i> to himself: “If so great the
reward for lying, with what gifts shall I not be presented, if,
according to my custom, I&nbsp;tell the truth?” The Ape then
<i>turns</i> to the Truthful Man: “And
<span class = "pagenum">467</span>
what do you think of me and those whom you see standing before me?” He
made answer: “You are a genuine Ape, and all these <i>are</i> Apes, who
are like you.” The King, enraged, ordered him to be torn with teeth and
claws, because he had told the truth.</p>

<p>A Man was disputing with a Lion which was the stronger of the two,
and while they were seeking evidence on the matter in dispute, they came
at last to a sepulchre, on which <i>the human disputant</i> pointed out
a Lion, depicted with his jaws rent asunder by a Man&mdash;a striking
proof of superior strength. The Lion made answer: “This was painted by a
human hand; if Lions knew how to paint, you would see the man undermost.
But I will give a more convincing proof of our valour.” He

deride him.” The Goose believing her, and immediately accepting her aid,
goes with her into the fields: forthwith comes the Hawk, and seizes the
Goose in his remorseless claws and devours her, while the Stork flies
off. The Goose <i>called out after her</i>: “He who trusts himself to so

Soaring aloft, the Kite brings back a field-mouse, most filthy, and
stinking from long-contracted mouldiness. “Is this,” said the Eagle,
“the performance of your promise?” The Kite replied to her: “That I

<p>With equal laws when Athens throve,</p>
<p>The petulance of freedom drove</p>
<p>Their state to license, which o’erthrew</p>
<p>Those just restraints of old they knew.</p>
<p>Hence, as a factious discontent</p>
<p>Through every rank and order went,</p>
<p>Pisistratus the tyrant form’d</p>
<p>A party, and the fort he storm’d:</p>
<p>Which yoke, while all bemoan’d in grief,</p>
<p>(Not that he was a cruel chief,</p>

<p class = "indent">
The Frogs, a freeborn people made,</p>
<p>From out their marsh with clamor pray’d</p>
<p>That Jove a monarch would assign</p>
<p>With power their manners to refine.</p>

<p>Sent his petitioners a log,</p>
<p>Which, as it dash’d upon the place,</p>
<p>At first alarm’d the tim’rous race.</p>
<p>But ere it long had lain to cool,</p>
<p>One slily peep’d out of the pool,</p>
<p>And finding it a king in jest,</p>
<p>He boldly summon’d all the rest.</p>
<p>Now, void of fear, the tribe advanced,</p>
<p>And on the timber leap’d and danced,</p>
<span class = "pagenum">475</span>
<p>And having let their fury loose,</p>
<p>In gross affronts and rank abuse,</p>
<p>Of Jove they sought another king,</p>
<p>For useless was this wooden thing.</p>
<p>Then he a water-snake empower’d,</p>
<p>Who one by one their race devour’d.</p>
<p>They try to make escape in vain,</p>
<p>Nor, dumb through fear, can they complain.</p>
<p>By stealth they Mercury depute,</p>
<p>That Jove would once more hear their suit,</p>
<p>And send their sinking state to save;</p>
<p>But he in wrath this answer gave:</p>
<p>“You scorn’d the good king that you had,</p>
<p>And therefore you shall bear the bad.”</p>

<p class = "indent">

A Grasshopper, in rank ill-will,</p>

<p>The Owl perceiving no redress,</p>

<p>That one man sometimes is more shrewd</p>

<p>To after-times I shall rehearse</p>
<p>In my concise familiar verse.</p>

<p class = "indent">
A certain man on his decease,</p>
<p>Left his three girls so much a-piece:</p>
<p>The first was beautiful and frail,</p>
<p>With eyes still hunting for the male;</p>
<p>The second giv’n to spin and card,</p>
<p>A country housewife working hard;</p>
<p>The third but very ill to pass,</p>
<p>A homely slut, that loved her glass.</p>
<p>The dying man had left his wife</p>
<p>Executrix, and for her life</p>
<p>Sole tenant, if she should fulfil</p>
<p>These strange provisos of his will:</p>
<p>“That she should give th’ estate in fee</p>
<p>In equal portions to the three;</p>
<p>But in such sort, that this bequest</p>
<p>Should not be holden or possess’d;</p>
<p>Then soon as they should be bereav’n</p>
<p>Of all the substance that was giv’n,</p>
<p>They must for their good mother’s ease</p>
<p>Make up an hundred sesterces.”</p>
<p>This spread through Athens in a trice;</p>
<p>The prudent widow takes advice.</p>
<p>But not a lawyer could unfold</p>
<p>How they should neither have nor hold</p>
<span class = "pagenum">513</span>
<p>The very things that they were left.</p>
<p>Besides, when once they were bereft,</p>
<p>How they from nothing should confer</p>
<p>The money that was due to her.</p>

<p class = "indent">
When a long time was spent in vain,</p>
<p>And no one could the will explain,</p>
<p>She left the counsellors unfeed,</p>
<p>And thus of her own self decreed:</p>
<p>The minstrels, trinkets, plate, and dress,</p>
<p>She gave the Lady to possess.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Notable she stocks</p>
<p>With all the fields, the kine and flocks:</p>
<p>The workmen, farm, with a supply</p>
<p>Of all the tools of husbandry.</p>
<p>Last, to the Guzzler she consigns</p>
<p>The cellar stored with good old wines,</p>
<p>A handsome house to see a friend,</p>
<p>With pleasant gardens at the end.</p>
<p>Thus as she strove th’ affair to close,</p>
<p>By giving each the things they chose,</p>
<p>And those that knew them every one</p>
<p>Highly applauded what was done</p>
<p>Esop arose, and thus address’d</p>
<p>The crowd that to his presence press’d:</p>
<p>“O that the dead could yet perceive!</p>
<p>How would the prudent father grieve,</p>
<p>That all th’ Athenians had not skill</p>
<p>Enough to understand his will<ins class = "correction" title = "close quote missing">!”&nbsp;</ins></p>
<p>Then at their joint request he solved</p>
<p>That error, which had all involved.</p>
<p>“The gardens, house, and wine vaults too,</p>
<p>Give to the spinster as her due;</p>
<p>The clothes, the jewels, and such ware,</p>
<p>Be all the tippling lady’s share;</p>
<p>The fields, the barns, and flocks of sheep,</p>
<p>Give the gay courtesan to keep.</p>
<p>Not one will bear the very touch</p>
<p>Of things that thwart their tastes so much;</p>
<p>The slut to fill her cellar straight</p>
<p>Her wardrobe will evacuate;</p>
<span class = "pagenum">514</span>
<p>The lady soon will sell her farms,</p>
<p>For garments to set off her charms;</p>
<p>But she that loves the flocks and kine</p>
<p>Will alienate her stores of wine,</p>
<p>Her rustic genius to employ.</p>
<p>Thus none their portions shall enjoy,</p>
<p>And from the money each has made</p>
<p>Their mother shall be duly paid.”</p>

<p>“You that would strike an insect dead</p>
<p>For one slight sting, in wrath so strict,</p>
<p>What punishment will you inflict</p>
<p>Upon yourself, who was so blunt</p>
<p>To do yourself this gross affront?”&mdash;</p>
<p>“O,” says the party, “as for me,</p>
<p>I with myself can soon agree.</p>
<p>The spirit of th’ intention’s all;</p>
<p>But thou, detested cannibal!</p>
<p>Blood-sucker! to have thee secured</p>
<p>More would I gladly have endured.”</p>

<p>Is&mdash;those who wrong not with intent</p>

A certain noble, on a day,</p>
<p>Having a mind to show away,</p>
<p>Invited by reward the mimes</p>
<p>And play’rs and tumblers of the times,</p>
<p>And built a large commodious stage</p>
<p>For the choice spirits of the age:</p>
<p>But, above all, amongst the rest</p>
<p>There came a genius who profess’d</p>
<p>To have a curious trick in store</p>
<p>That never was perform’d before.</p>
<p>Through all the town this soon got air,</p>
<p>And the whole house was like a fair;</p>
<p>But soon his entry as he made,</p>
<p>Without a prompter or parade,</p>
<p>’Twas all expectance and suspense,</p>
<p>And silence gagg’d the audience.</p>
<p>He, stooping down and looking big,</p>
<p>So wondrous well took off a pig,</p>
<p>All swore ’twas serious, and no joke,</p>
<p>For that, or underneath his cloak</p>
<p>He had concealed some grunting elf,</p>
<p>Or was a real hog himself.</p>
<span class = "pagenum">531</span>
<p>A search was made&mdash;no pig was found&mdash;</p>
<p>With thund’ring claps the seats resound,</p>
<p>And pit, and box, and gall’ries roar</p>
<p>With&mdash; “O rare! bravo!” and “encore.”</p>
<p>Old Roger Grouse, a country clown,</p>
<p>Who yet knew something of the town,</p>
<p>Beheld the mimic of his whim,</p>
<p>And on the morrow challenged him</p>
<p>Declaring to each beau and belle</p>
<p>That he this grunter would excel.</p>
<p>The morrow came&mdash;the crowd was greater&mdash;</p>
<p>But prejudice and rank ill-nature</p>
<p>Usurp’d the minds of men and wenches,</p>
<p>Who came to hiss and break the benches.</p>
<p>The mimic took his usual station,</p>
<p>And squeak’d with general approbation;</p>
<p>Again “Encore! encore!” they cry&mdash;</p>
<p>“’Tis quite the thing, ’tis very high.”</p>
<p>Old Grouse conceal’d, amidst this racket,</p>
<p>A real pig beneath his jacket&mdash;</p>
<p>Then forth he came, and with his nail</p>
<p>He pinch’d the urchin by the tail.</p>
<p>The tortured pig, from out his throat,</p>
<p>Produced the genuine nat’ral note.</p>
<p>All bellow’d out ’twas very sad!</p>
<p>Sure never stuff was half so bad.</p>
<p>“That like a pig!” each cried in scoff;</p>
<p>“Pshaw! nonsense! blockhead! off! off! off!”</p>
<p>The mimic was extoll’d, and Grouse</p>
<p>Was hiss’d, and catcall’d from the house.</p>
<p>“Soft ye, a word before I go,”</p>
<p>Quoth honest Hodge; and stooping low,</p>
<p>Produced the pig, and thus aloud</p>
<p>Bespoke the stupid partial crowd:</p>
<p>“Behold, and learn from this poor cratur,</p>
<p>How much you critics know of natur!”</p>
